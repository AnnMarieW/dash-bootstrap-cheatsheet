One example is Bootstrap 5 now supports RTL, so classes are renamed “start” and “end” instead of “left” and “right”. This means the new way to set left or right margin is className="ms-2 me-4" rather than className="ml-2 mr-4". There are also many new things like the opacity classes, and classes that make it easier to make components like: image
